        <p class="t-quote">"When we walked into the store, we were treated very warmly. I described my needs, and Keith offered many suggestions. It took 3 tries to find the right computer for me, and Keith was with me and helpful at each step. He and his staff are so patient and kind. Their customer service is top notch, and the products are high quality."</p>

        <p class="t-quote">"I own and operate a video production company.  I had Prime Systems build me a custom video editing computer.  They did an excellent job.  My Dad just bought a laptop computer about 4 weeks ago.  Keith Duncan came to my Dad's house (after he closed his business for the day) and actually set-up the laptop, wireless network and printer.  I was totally blown away the Keith (the owner) took the time to help my Dad.  You will never get this kind of customer treatment from a big box store"</p>

        <p class="t-quote">"Despite PC Laptop's horrific commercials, I still gave them a shot...I had a guy tell me flat out lies to my face, not to mention their price was over twice as much for the EXACT SAME SPECS as anywhere else. Prime Systems, on the other hand, keeps prices low, but still offer the best service in the state. They don't lie to your face, aren't arrogant and work with you. They may be a little understaffed so you have to be patient with getting a hold of techs or even salesmen, HOWEVER this is one thing they do to keep their costs down so they can sell stuff at a good price, so it's worth the patience for the best computer and service package. You could get probably find a cheaper one at Walmart or Dell, but then you'll regret it the first time your computer gives you a problem. Prime Systems has always backed their warranty, don't go anywhere else!!!"</p>
